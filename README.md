# Repositories that i will use for the projects
The Repositories that will be used is the CMPG323Overview-33758247 Repository as all the projects will be linked to this repository.If it gets to difficult to manage all my projects in 1 repository i will create new repositories to keep my work neat.

# Branching strategy that i will use for the projects
At the moment i have only one branch which would be the main branch. When starting with the new projects i am going to create new branches to keep the main branch clutter free. This will also help when something is not working the way it should as it would not be commited to the main branch until it does what it is intended to do.

# Explain the use of .gitignore file in each project
Git ignore will be used in the project when I only want to update a certain part of the project as to not change everything when committing to the main branch. git ignore will help keep all my projects seperate and also keep my commits from clashing and corrupting data.

# Explain how confidential information will be stored

Confidential dat will be stored securely. 
No data will be sent through texts(Whatsapp etc.)
